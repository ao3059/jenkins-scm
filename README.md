Jenkins-SCM Project
Objective
The goal of this project is to set up a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. This pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Node.js application inside a Docker container.

Technologies Used
Jenkins: For continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline automation.
Docker: For containerizing the Node.js application.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for building web applications.
nvm: Node Version Manager, to manage multiple Node.js versions.
GitHub: For version control and source code management.
Project Structure
Jenkinsfile: Defines the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. It specifies the pipeline's stages, such as pulling code from GitHub, installing dependencies, running tests, and building Docker images.
Dockerfile: Contains the instructions for building a Docker image for the Node.js application. It includes:
Pulling the Node.js base image.
Copying the application files into the image.
Installing project dependencies.
Exposing the port on which the application will run (port 80).
package.json: Contains the metadata for the Node.js project. It defines dependencies (such as Jest for testing) and scripts for tasks like running tests.
README.md: This file, documenting the project structure and the steps taken to implement and run the project.
Steps for Implementation

1. Install Jenkins on a Server
Set up Jenkins on a dedicated server to automate CI/CD tasks.
Install required Jenkins plugins (Git, Docker, etc.).

2. Set Up GitHub Integration
Create a public GitHub repository.
Configure Jenkins to pull the source code from the GitHub repository:
bash

https://github.com/ao3059/jenkins-scm.git

3. Set Up the Jenkins Pipeline
Created a Jenkinsfile with the following stages:
Connect to GitHub: Clones the repository from GitHub.
Install Node.js and npm: Uses nvm to install and use Node.js version 18.x.
Install Dependencies: Installs project dependencies using npm install.
Run Tests: Executes the tests using Jest.
Build Docker Image: Builds a Docker image for the application using the Dockerfile.
Run Docker Container: Runs the built Docker container to serve the application.

4. Docker Setup
Dockerfile was created with the following:
Pulls the base Node.js image node:18.
Copies the application files into the Docker container.
Installs Node.js dependencies.
Exposes port 80.
Defines the entry point to run the application using CMD.
Built the Docker image using:
bash

docker build -t my-ecommerce-app .
Ran the Docker container using:
bash

docker run -d -p 8081:80 my-ecommerce-app


5. Testing
Unit Testing: The pipeline uses Jest for running tests. Tests are executed in the Run Tests stage.
Challenges:
Node.js Version Mismatch: Jenkins was using the wrong Node.js version. This was resolved by configuring nvm to install and switch to Node.js version 18.x.
Missing or Failing Tests: Initially, tests failed due to missing files. The issues were resolved by adding test files or using appropriate Jest configurations to handle missing tests.


6. Deploying the Application
After the Docker container was successfully built, it was run to expose the application at http://localhost:8081.
Verified deployment by accessing the application, which displayed the message:
arduino

Congratulations, you have successfully run your first pipeline code.
Issues Encountered and Solutions
1. Node Version Mismatch
Problem: Jenkins was using the wrong Node.js version.
Solution: Configured the Jenkins pipeline to install and use Node.js version 18.x using nvm.
2. Testing Errors
Problem: Jest encountered errors due to missing test files.
Solution: Placeholder test files were added, or tests were skipped using appropriate Jest configurations.
3. Docker Deployment
Problem: Docker container wasnâ€™t exposing the correct ports.
Solution: Verified the port configuration in the Dockerfile and the running container using docker inspect.
